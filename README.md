# HeatingControl

Software for a domestic heating control system. This software runs on a [Particle Photon](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/intro/photon/) device as part of an embedded system that can control two heating zones based on remote temperature readings, a programmed schedule and user input.

The project makes use of the [Blynk](https://www.blynk.cc/) library for interfacing with mobile devices.

## Features
 - Two zone heating control
 - Remote temperature monitoring
 - User control via mobile phone
 - 7 stage, per zone, per day, customisable temperature schedule
 - 1-hour temporary overrides
 - Away mode
 - System temperature monitoring
 - Startup & boiler cycling safety delays
